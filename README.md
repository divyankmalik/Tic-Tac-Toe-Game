In Winter 2023, I developed this two-player Tic Tac Toe game, gaining hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used HTML to build the game's structure, CSS to style the interface, and JavaScript to handle the gameâ€™s logic. This interactive game allows two players to enter their names, play as Player1 and Player2, and receive a display announcing the winner upon completion. Through this project, I enhanced my skills in front-end development, creating a fun and engaging user experience.
